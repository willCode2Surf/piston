## a lil' git server

## where we're at:

* HTTP/pushover
* bare repos
* UNTESTED github webhook that triggers a pull from github
* stub for implementing DELETE on user repos (not implemented)

## what do we need:

* tarball service? (another app definitely)
* more non-git api calls? Like what?
* a sense of users? Is there a users db?
* https?
* ssh?? (not with pushover for sure; wrap gitolite?)
